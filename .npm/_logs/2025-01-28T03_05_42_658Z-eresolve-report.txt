# npm resolution error report

While resolving: bootlover-frontend@0.1.0
Found: react@18.3.1
node_modules/react
  react@"^18.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.0.0" from react-wheel-of-prizes@1.1.0
node_modules/react-wheel-of-prizes
  react-wheel-of-prizes@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
